1) git clone - is a command that creates a copy of a Git repository on your local machine. It downloads all the files and history from the remote repository to your local machine, allowing you to work on the code and track changes.

2) git checkout <branch name> is a command that allows you to switch to a different branch in your local repository. You can use this command to move between different branches of code that you are working on, or to create a new branch.

3) git add to stage the changes you want to commit

4) git commit to create a new commit with a message describing the changes. 

5) git push to upload the changes to the remote repository.

6) pull request - you first fork the repository you want to contribute to. Then, you create a new branch on your fork, make your changes, and push the branch to your fork. Finally, you go to the original repository and create a pull request from your fork, asking the maintainers to review and merge your changes into their codebase.

7) To merge a pull request into a branch on GitHub, the repository maintainers review the changes and approve the pull request. Once approved, the maintainers can merge the changes into their branch, incorporating the changes made by the contributor. This process ensures that the code is reviewed and tested before it is integrated into the main codebase.
